<!-- Introduction to responsive web design-->

      <article>
        <p><strong>Why responsive web design?</strong> If your website has tiny fonts and is impossible to navigate on a mobile device, you might want to make it responsive. If you are tired of maintaining two websites (one for desktop, one for mobile), you might want to transition to a single, responsive site. If your SEO rank has dropped because your website isn't optimized for mobile, you might want to change to responsive page layouts, with appropriately sized images, so pages load faster on mobile.</p>

        <p><strong>Responsive web design is a technique that introduces a fluid grid for page content that adjusts to fit different screen sizes.</strong> 
        It's a way to build a single website that can be accessed on a variety of devices: desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, and even smart watches. Utilizing media queries and appropriately sized images, your website can load faster on mobile, which will ultimately help your SEO rank.</p>

        <p><strong>Ready to make the leap to responsive? Great.</strong> A mobile first approach is highly recommended. With this approach, you can design your content and layout for small screens on mobile first, then figure out how to scale it to larger devices and screen sizes.</p>
